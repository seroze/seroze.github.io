Things to keep in mind that will stop you from making progress
Just like how warren buffet thinks ask in what way could I fail and stop doing that

1. Internalize concepts don't be in a rush to increase your problem solved count, that won't matter anyway, the skill to think on feet matters.
2. Looking at the editorial is almost always a dangerous thing, only look when you have given your 100% and that too read one line and close it, ask why you weren't able to think in that direction.
3. Implement your ideas, don't just mind solve. Half the game is to implement things quickly and bug-free way.

Goals:
- Think before you code
- Become fast at writing code, debugging and handling edge cases
- Solve hard problems
