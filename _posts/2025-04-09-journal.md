- [] I need to atleast implement the skiplist part with iterator for kvarkDB
- [X] Implemented threadpool in java, learnt about spurious wake ups

If you are using wait(), notify()/notifyAll() pattern then we should always put
the wait() inside a while loop with some condition because JVM can wake up that
thread randomly even though no one called notify() for it.

This is because it's an overhead for JVM to keep track of which thread is waiting on
which notification.

```
synchronized(lock) {
    while (!condition) {
        lock.wait();
    }
    // do something when condition is true
}
```
